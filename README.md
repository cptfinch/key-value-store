# key-value-store
- Have chosen the first option.
- I first looked at using javascript and utilising an existing key-value-store such as RabbitMQ. After doing a tutorial of that I decided it would be better and more interesting to implement a simple KVS using Erlang.
- I had the book Programming Erlang, software for a concurrent world, on my shelf. Had bought it ages ago but hadn't had the opportunity to go through it.
- After familiarising myself with the Erlang language I then moved on to chapter 10, distributed programming. My plan was to implement a simple key-value server that I could test using simply a client process and a server process on my laptop. Then would come the task of extending it so that I could talk to the server using TCP.
